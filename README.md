This is a custom react Radio Button component. You can use this component as a child for your component. The component takes an array, id and an onClick function as props. 

- id="testval" 
- radioOptions={optionsArray} 
- onClick={this.handleOnClick}

radioOptions: here is a an array{numbers,string or bool} values of which would be considered as the Options Labels and values of the radio buttons.

id: is the id for the whole component which can be used to set the model value for which the Radio Button component was used.

Feel free to suggest modification to the code and to create PR.
